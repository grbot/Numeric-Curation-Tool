This is another concept for the much needed curation tool.
You can find the jquery ui docs online.
Note the use of JSONP to grab information from the Khan API...

TODO:
* correctly populate the lists (KA list can use /api/v1/topictree to pull all video titles in, though we might want to curate just certain topics at a given time. Also, we'll want to pull in info from our database (not yet RESTful, but its on the cards).
* We want a bin to throw old curated exercises away. This is a mockup for now, so I've pulled the exercises in because I had the URL on me...
* We also want the rhs to be clickable (like the lhs), and to narrow exactly what it must do. Then make a save to pdf button using php to make the pdf...
* We'll then worry about the exact look and feel of the app.
* Then we'll figure out how to get it online.
